  <p><stache-code>skyux watch</stache-code> runs the <stache-code>test</stache-code> command and watches the file system for changes. The <stache-code>watch</stache-code> command monitors changes in much the same way as the <stache-code>serve</stache-code> command, but for testing, the <stache-code>watch</stache-code> command is always running, much like debug mode in Visual Studio. If you change a test, the window is watching that and runs the test. This command is useful when writing a bunch of tests.</p>
