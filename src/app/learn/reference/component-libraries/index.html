    After you create components with SKY UX, you can organize them into reusable libraries and publish them for other SPAs to consume. This reference describes how to create and consume SKY UX component libraries.
  </stache-page-summary>
  
  <sky-alert alertType="info">For internal Blackbaud component libraries, Blackbaud developers follow a different workflow to create libraries and publish them to an internal Blackbaud NPM stream. Documentation on this process is available on <a href="https://host.nxt.blackbaud.com/engineering-system-docs/learn/spa">the Engineering System website</a>.

    Install dependencies
  </stache-page-anchor>

  <p>
    The first step to author a SKY UX component library is to create a SPA and specify a base template with a starter module for creating component libraries. To do this, run <stache-code>skyux new</stache-code> from the SKY UX CLI and use the <stache-code>--template</stache-code> option to specify the <stache-code>library</stache-code> template.
  </p>

  <stache-code-block>
    skyux new --template library
  </stache-code-block>

  <p>
    This command uses the library template to create a SPA, and the library template places source files in <stache-code>/src/app/public</stache-code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    After you specify the library template, follow the instructions <a href="https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux2/learn/get-started/3.-create-project" target="_blank">to set up a local SKY UX application</a>.
  </p>

  <stache-page-anchor>
    Create components for the library
  </stache-page-anchor>
  
  <p>
    In the new SPA, create the components for the library. SKY UX Builder ignores components in <stache-code>/src/app/public</stache-code>, so they are not automatically declared in <stache-code>SkyModule</stache-code>. This allows you to write Angular modules, components, and services outside of SKY UX's scope.
  </p>

  <p>
    The entry point for the component library is <stache-code>/src/app/public/index.ts</stache-code>. This file is responsible for exporting any code you want to make available to the bundler.
  </p>

  <stache-page-anchor>
    Bundle the library
  </stache-page-anchor>
  
  <p>
    After you create the components for the library, you are ready to bundle them into a consumable NPM module that you can publish to an NPM stream such as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npmjs.org</a>. To do this, run <stache-code>skyux build-public-library</stache-code> from the SKY UX CLI.
  </p>

  <stache-code-block>
    skyux build-public-library
  </stache-code-block>

  <p>
    This command creates a bundle that is NPM-ready and places it in a <stache-code>/dist</stache-code> directory. It bundles the components in <stache-code>/src/app/public</stache-code> and ignores all other files, but it does not publish the component library.
  </p>

  <stache-page-anchor>
    Publish the library
  </stache-page-anchor>

  <p>
    After you bundle components into a consumable NPM module, you can publish the library to an NPM stream to allow other SKY UX SPAs to install the library. We recommend that you publish public libraries to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npmjs.org</a>. You can use Travis-CI, a free GitHub continuous integration service, to publish the component library to npmjs.org.
  </p>

    <sky-alert alertType="info">For internal Blackbaud component libraries, Blackbaud developers publish private component libraries to an internal Blackbaud NPM stream using a process that is documented on <a href="https://host.nxt.blackbaud.com/engineering-system-docs/learn/spa">the Engineering System website</a>.

  <!--
Commenting out this section because I don't think we need it given that it doesn't seem to be necessary for internal development. But leaving it in place for now as a reminder to make sure that's the case when Jon's development on the internal portal is complete. If we don't need this, delete it. If we do end up needing this, we also need to add back the subheader for the previous paragraph "Publish a public library to npmjs.org.
  <h3>
    Publish to a private library to Blackbaud's internal-only NPM stream
  </h3>

  <p>
    This option is for internal Blackbaud use only. To publish private libraries to Blackbaud's NPM stream, Blackbaud developers need to register the SPAs for their component libraries through the appropriate VSTS pipeline. Reach out to Jonathan Bell for more information.

  <stache-page-anchor>
    Consume the library in another SPA
  </stache-page-anchor>

  <p>
    After you publish the component library, other SKY UX SPAs can install it. To consume a SKY UX component library, the SPA imports the library through <stache-code>/app/src/app-extras.module.ts</stache-code>
  </p>
  <stache-code-block languageType="typescript">
    import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

    import { LibraryModule } from 'my-component-library';

    @NgModule({
      imports: [
        LibraryModule
      ],
      exports: [
        LibraryModule
      ]
    })
    export class AppExtrasModule { }
  </stache-code-block>

  <stache-page-anchor>
    Access the consuming SPA's configuration
  </stache-page-anchor>

  <p>
    After a SPA consumes a component library, the library requires an adapter to access <stache-code>SkyAppConfig</stache-code> in the consuming SPA.
  </p>

  <p>
    SKY UX does not transpile source files in <stache-code>@blackbaud/skyux-builder/runtime</stache-code> as a <a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/2014/what-is-amd-commonjs-and-umd/">UMD module</a>, so they cannot be <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/codelyzer">analyzed statically</a>. Therefore, a component library cannot directly reference <stache-code>@blackbaud/skyux-builder/runtime</stache-code> files such as <stache-code>SkyAppConfig</stache-code> because the library will eventually become a UMD module. Instead, the component library requires an adaptor class in the consuming SPA that can be provided in the transpiled version of <stache-code>SkyAppConfig</stache-code> at runtime.
  </p>

  <p>
    The following code sample demonstrates how to create an adaptor in the <stache-code>/app/src/app-extras.module.ts</stache-code> file in a consuming SPA.
  </p>

  <stache-code-block languageType="typescript">
    import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

    import { SkyAppConfig } from '@blackbaud/skyux-builder/runtime';

    import { LibraryModule, LibraryConfigService } from 'my-component-library';

    @NgModule({
      imports: [
        LibraryModule
      ],
      exports: [
        LibraryModule
      ],
      providers: [
        // The config service acts as an adaptor for skyuxconfig.json:
        {
          provide: LibraryConfigService,
          useExisting: SkyAppConfig
        }
      ]
    })
    export class AppExtrasModule { }
  </stache-code-block>

  <stache-page-anchor>
    Provide configuration for the library
  </stache-page-anchor>

  <p>
    After you create an adaptor in the consuming SPA's <stache-code>/app/src/app-extras.module.ts</stache-code> file, you can provide configuration for the library through the <stache-code>skyuxconfig.json</stache-code> file in the project's directory. In this file, the <stache-code>appSettings</stache-code> property specifies data that is available for reuse throughout the application, and you can use it to add any properties that are necessary for the component library.
  </p>

  <stache-code-block languageType="json">
    {
      "appSettings": {
        "myLibrary": {
          "foo": "bar",
          "baz": true
        }
      }
    }
  </stache-code-block>

  <p>
    After you add properties through <stache-code>appSettings</stache-code> for the component library, you can access them in your components by injecting the <stache-code>LibraryConfigService</stache-code> in <stache-code>/app/src/public/src/modules/shared/config.service.ts</stache-code>.
  </p>

  <stache-code-block languageType="typescript">
    import { LibraryConfigService } from '../shared';

    @Component({ ... })
    export class MyLibraryComponent {
      constructor(public configService: LibraryConfigService) {
        console.log(configService.appSettings.myLibrary.foo); // "bar"
      }
    }

  </stache-code-block>
</stache>
