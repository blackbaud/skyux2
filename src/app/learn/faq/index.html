    <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
    <p>This section provides answers to frequently asked questions about SKY UX 2. These questions and answers are taken from on the <a href="https://blackbaud.slack.com/messages/1bb-skyux-apps/">1bb-skyux-apps Slack channel</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>What is the recommended best practice for getting the latest?</h3>
    <p>The command to get the latest is <code>npm install -g @blackbaud/skyux-cli@latest</code>. The SKY UX CLI notifies users when a new version is released. If a new version is available when users run <code>skyux serve</code>, then a message appears in the command prompt.</p>

    <h3>What is the timeline for SKY UX 2 to be production-ready?</h3>
    <p>SKY UX components are production-ready now. We are still in beta because not every component has been moved over and because we still need to create documentation.</p>

    <h3>What is the timeline to be able to deploy SKY SPAs for use in production?</h3>
    <p>The SKY UX Host, Builder, and CLI pieces can be used to build a production app. Blue Steel is doing this now with a release target of February. It just requires some manual steps and patience with some suboptimal workflow while we automate more and add more user-friendly features.</p>

    <h3>Will deployment of SKY UX SPAs be automated through https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux-deploy?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Currently, any merge to your master branch triggers a release to production. We plan to change that to state a release with an endpoint or a user interface where you can flag staged releases as production releases.</p>

    <h3>Since the app repository exists solely for UI components, do you need a separate repo if you need a backend deployed to perform business logic or some other action?</h3>
    <p>Yes</p>
