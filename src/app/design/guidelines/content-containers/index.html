<stache-page-anchor>Divide a page into sections of related content</stache-page-anchor>

<h3 class="sky-subsection-heading"><a routerLink="/components/tile">Tile</a></h3>

<p>Tiles are containers to divide and group categories of heterogeneous content on a page. DO NOT use tiles to represent individual items in a set of items — use cards if you want to contain items in a list within individual bounding boxes. Content inside each tile can (and often will) vary widely. Tiles can be reordered and repositioned within the page. Tiles can be expanded and collapsed, and their default state can be determined by the situation.</p>
  
<p>Tiles can contain toolbars to house actions related to their content.</p>
  
<h3 class="sky-subsection-heading"><a routerLink="/components/tabs">Tab</a></h3>  

<p>Tabs are containers to divide large subsets of content on a page. A set of tabs should serve as categories of page content, not as a list of similar items. The contents of each tab can be considered like a page and can contain any other container or arrangement of content.</p>

<stache-page-anchor>Present instances of a collection of related items</stache-page-anchor>

<h3 class="sky-subsection-heading"><a routerLink="/components/card">Card</a></h3>

  <p>Cards list items in a set of rectangular containers instead of rows. The card decks can appear in different layouts, such as <a routerLink="/components/grid">grids</a>. Content and presentation can be determined per card list instance. Cards can be selected (multi-select via checkbox) for bulk actions, and can also contain item-specific actions in an action bar or context menu.</p>

<p>If you use cards within a tile, consider using them with a carousel that accounts for the width of its container.</p>

<h3 class="sky-subsection-heading"><a routerLink="/components/repeater">Repeater list</a></h3>

<p>Repeater lists display lists of items that do not use columns. The content and presentation inside the row can be determined per list. Rows in a repeater list can be selected (multi-select via checkbox) for bulk actions. Each row can contain hyperlinks (usually on the “primary” label), but row-specific actions should be collected into the row's context menu.</p>
  
<p>Repeaters can be used in full-page formats, tabs, tiles, or dialogues.</p>
  
<h3 class="sky-subsection-heading"><a routerLink="/components/grid">Grid</a></h3>

<p>Grids list items in table format (i.e. defined columns). Content and presentation of each row and column can be determined per list, but must conform to column breakdowns. Columns can be shown/hidden/reordered, and content can be sorted based on values inside specific columns.</p>
  
<p>Grids commonly use a toolbar containing search, filter controls, column selection, and other actions.</p>

<p>Grids should generally be used in full-page formats or inside of full-page tabs. When designing within a smaller container such as a tile, try using a repeater instead since they scale down better than grids.</p>

<stache-page-anchor>Reveal content that is not always visible</stache-page-anchor>

<h3 class="sky-subsection-heading"><a routerLink="/components/modal">Modal</a></h3>

<p>Modals focus user attention on specific tasks. Modals are appropriate in scenarios that meet one or more of these conditions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users cannot complete the task until they provide more information or make additional choices.</li>
  <li>The task is self-contained and does not need the context of the underlying page.</li>
  <li>The task is secondary to the purpose of the underlying page.</li>
  <li>The task interface is too complex to fit within the container where it was invoked.</li>
  <li>The interface where the task is invoked would be too distracting for the user to efficiently complete the task inline.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="sky-subsection-heading"><a routerLink="/components/popover">Popover</a></h3>

<p>Popovers show small chunks of information that are only occasionally relevant to the user. If the content is relevant most of the time, it should be presented in-page instead. If the amount of content would require scrolling on a mobile device, use a modal instead.</p>
