  <stache-page-summary>
    <p>This reference provides guidance on unit tests and end-to-end tests in SKY UX projects. The continuous integration layer of SKY UX runs unit tests, visual regression tests, and end-to-end tests in multiple platforms and browsers when the SPA code changes or when an SPA dependency releases a new version. It also handles staging the SPA for additional testing and validation.</p>

    Unit tests
  </stache-page-anchor>
  <p>SKY UX automatically configures <a href="https://karma-runner.github.io">Karma</a> to run unit tests in the <stache-code>src/app</stache-code> folder that match the <stache-code>.spec.ts</stache-code> pattern. We recommend that you follow the <a href="https://angular.io/styleguide#!#naming">Angular naming guidelines</a> on how to name spec files and where to store them. SKY UX unit tests should use the same name as the components or services that they test, but they should end with <stache-code>.spec.ts.</stache-code> And you place the spec files in the same folder as the components or services that they test. When you run <stache-code>skyux test</stache-code> or <stache-code>skyux watch</stache-code>, code coverage results are stored in the <stache-code>coverage</stache-code> folder.</p>
  <p>When you <a routerLink="/learn/get-started/basics/create-project">create a SKY UX project</a>, the template includes sample unit tests that <a routerLink="/learn/get-started/basics/run-tests">you can run to test the default single-page-application</a>. From the command line, you can use <a routerLink="/learn/reference/cli-commands/test">the <stache-code>skyux test</stache-code> command</a> to run unit tests and <a routerLink="/learn/reference/cli-commands/watch">the <stache-code>skyux watch</stache-code> command</a> to run unit tests and watch the file system for changes.</p>
  <p>SKY UX styles are loaded when running unit tests, so CSS rules defined in SKY UX take effect during tests. This allows you to check the expected computed style of an element when using things like the HTML <stache-code>hidden</stache-code> property that only take effect when SKY UX styles are loaded.</p>

  <stache-page-anchor>
    End-to-end (e2e) tests
  </stache-page-anchor>
  <p>SKY UX automatically configures <a href="http://www.protractortest.org">Protractor</a> to run end-to-end tests in the <stache-code>e2e</stache-code> folder that match the <stache-code>.e2e-spec.ts</stache-code> pattern. We recommend that you follow the <a href="https://angular.io/styleguide#!#naming">Angular naming guidelines</a> on how to name spec files and where to store them. SKY UX end-to-end tests should use the same name as the components or services that they test, but they should end with <stache-code>.e2e-spec.ts.</stache-code> Unlike unit tests, you should not place these spec files in the same folder as the components or services that they test. Instead, you should place them in the <stache-code>e2e</stache-code> folder in the root of your project.</p>
  <p>When you <a routerLink="/learn/get-started/basics/create-project">create a SKY UX project</a>, the template includes a sample end-to-end test that <a routerLink="/learn/get-started/basics/run-tests">you can run to test the default single-page application</a>. From the command line, you can use <a routerLink="/learn/reference/cli-commands/e2e">the <stache-code>skyux e2e</stache-code> command</a> to run end-to-end tests.
