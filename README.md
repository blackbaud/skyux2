# SKY UX 2

An alpha version of SKY UX 2 built on Angular 2 is now available.  It can be installed via NPM (we recommend NPM version 3 for its flat dependency structure):

`npm install blackbaud-skyux2`

We're still working on documentation, but we do have rudimentary examples available in the SKY UX 2 repo.  To run them, clone this repo locally, then run `npm install` followed by `npm start`.  This will serve up the examples at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).  If you plan on contributing SKY UX 2 you may use the NPM scripts below to test and build your feature.
