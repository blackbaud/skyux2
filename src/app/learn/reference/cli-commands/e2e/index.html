  <p><stache-code>skyux e2e</stache-code> runs end-to-end tests that test your SPA running in a real browser, interacting with it as users would. The <stache-code>e2e</stache-code> command uses a tool called Protractor to look for files in the <stache-code>e2e</stache-code> folder with names that end in <stache-code>.e2e-spec.ts</stache-code>. End-to-end tests supplement the Karma unit test, but end-to-end files are written slightly differently. Both test files use a syntax called Jasmine. For more information about end-to-end tests, see <a routerLink="/learn/reference/tests">the end-to-end test reference</a>.</p>
