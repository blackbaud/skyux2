    <p>The reference section provides technical resources to help manage SKY UX projects, including SKY UX CLI commands, configuration options, and file placement and naming conventions.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> is at the heart of SKY UX 2, so you need to be familiar with this technology to build with SKY UX. For learning resources for Angular and other SKY UX tools and technologies, see <a routerLink="/learn/reference/resources">the training resources.</a></p>
  <sky-alert alertType="info">Keep in mind that some options in the references are for internal Blackbaud use only. External developers can use SKY UX to create, test, and run SKY UX SPAs. And SKY UX components, services, and modules are open source and available in <a href="https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2">the SKY UX 2 GitHub repo</a>. However, not all SKY UX features are available for external use.</sky-alert>
