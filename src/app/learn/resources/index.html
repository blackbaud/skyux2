    <p><a href="https://angular.io/">Angular 2</a> is at the heart of SKY UX 2, so you need to be familiar with this technology to build with SKY UX. In addition, you should be familiar with several other tools and technologies. This page provides recommended learning resources for some of these tools.</p>
    
    <h2>Key tools and technologies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Angular 2</strong> — Angular 2 is the key building block of SKY UX 2. Check out the <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/">Angular docs</a>, and see <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/learning-angular.html">Learning Angular</a> for a suggested path for Angular newcomers. A <a href="http://www.angular2.com/">curated list of Angular 2 resources</a> provides additional tutorials, courses, and other learning material. And for a guide to Angular syntax, conventions, and application structure, see the <a href="https://angular.io/styleguide">Angular 2 Style Guide</a>.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Node.js</strong> — Node is a JavaScript runtime that is a prerequisite for SKY UX Builder. Node.js uses an event-driven, nonblocking I/O model to build scalable network applications. For more information, see the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js website</a>.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>NPM</strong> — NPM is a package manager for JavaScript that runs through the command line and manages dependencies. NPM is the default for Node.js, and it is a prerequisite for SKY UX Builder. For more information, see the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM website</a>.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Git</strong> — Git is an open source distributed version control system, and you need to create Git repos for your SKY UX 2 projects. For more information, see <a href="https://git-scm.com/documentation"> the Git documentation</a>, explore the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial">introduction tutorial</a>, or check out GitHub's <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">hello world project</a>.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>TypeScript</strong> — TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. For more information, see the <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript website</a> and the <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/tutorial.html">quick start tutorial</a>.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Sass</strong> — Sass is a CSS extension language that has two syntaxes. SASS is the older, indented syntax that uses the .sass extension. SCSS is the more common syntax that is a superset of CSS3 syntax, and it uses the .scss extension. For more information, see the <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS website</a>.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Additional resources</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Fat-arrow functions</strong> — Arrow functions are <a href="https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/docs/arrow-functions.html">a syntax for JavaScript functions</a> that save time and simplify function scope.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Observables</strong> — Angular observables are similar to promises, but observables are cancellable and can handle multiple values over time. For more information, see this <a href="https://angular-2-training-book.rangle.io/handout/observables/using_observables.html">observables example</a> and this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyNxXha3S3E">observables video</a>.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Flexbox CSS guide</strong> — Flexbox, or CSS Flexible Box, is <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">a layout mode that arranges elements</a> on a page so that they behave predictably for different devices and screen sizes.</p></li>
    </ul>

<!--
o	Somewhere on this page (or on the Learn page), it would be nice to have training resources/links for recommended learning that most developers will need to learn before jumping in.  There are a lot of developers where this is an entirely new realm of technologies and tools for them, so any simple introductions to things would be helpful.  I don’t think you need to write all this info, just provide links to recommended resources maybe.  I imagine this would also be a good spot for links to the “in-house” training next week that I think will be recorded.  Things like:
	Node.js – What is it?  How does it fit in with Sky?
	NPM – What is it?
	Git – Basic understanding of common commands and how git works?
	TypeScript – Intro resources?
	Angular 2 – Intro resources?
	scss
