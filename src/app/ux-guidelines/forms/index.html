<stache-page-summary><p>SKYUX provides various form patterns to accommodate different scenarios and workflow requirements.</p></stache-page-summary>

<div class="sky-subsection-heading">Inline panel</div>
<p>An inline panel is appropriate for simple forms that meets the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The form has few fields, and its input controls are not complex.</li>
  <li>The content that surrounds the form will not distract users.</li>
  <li>The task is functionally non-modal, and users can abandon it while the form is open.</li>
</ul>

<div class="sky-subsection-heading">Modal dialog</div>
<p>A <a routerLink="../../components/modal">Modal</a> dialog is appropriate for forms that meet any of the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The task is functionally modal, and users must finish it before doing anything else.</li>
  <li>Displaying the form inline would lead to a large amount of content shifting or require users to scroll to complete the form.</li>
  <li>The form adds records from [a paginated list](../../components/pagination) or [an infinite scroll list](../../components/infinitescroll).</li>
</ul>
  
<div class="sky-subsection-heading">Full-page modal</div>
<p>A <a routerLink="../../components/modal">Full-page modal</a> is appropriate for forms that meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The task is functionally modal, and users must finish it before doing anything else.</li>
  <li>Users usually perform the task in a large viewport, and a full-page modal can optimize the use of space.</li>
  <li>The context of the task is self-contained.</li>
  <li>The form displays ancillary information or previews such as running totals or an email being constructed.</li>
  <li>The form supports a complex task for a list of objects such as filling out report cards for a class.</li>
<li>The task includes subtasks that need to be completed in context.</li>
</ul>

<div class="sky-subsection-heading">Wizard</div>
<p>A <a routerLink="../../components/wizard">Wizard</a> is appropriate for forms that meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The task can be divided into discrete steps.</li>
  <li>The order of the steps is important.</li>
  <li>User actions in earlier steps affect later steps.</li>
  <li>Users must complete or review the fields in every step.</li>
  <li>Users might want to save their progress so that they can leave the form and return later.</li>
</ul>
