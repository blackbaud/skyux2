    After you create components with SKY UX, you can organize them into libraries and publish them for other SPAs to consume. This reference describes how to create reusable component libraries for SKY UX.

    Overview
  </stache-page-anchor>

  Steve: I hid the overview because it was blank. I fleshed out the summary at the top of the page, so I don't think we need an overview. But let me know if you disagree and want to work with me on what to add here.

    Install dependencies
  </stache-page-anchor>

  <p>
    The first step to author a SKY UX component library is to create a SPA and specify a base template with the starter module for creating component libraries. To do this, run <stache-code>skyux new</stache-code> from the SKY UX CLI and use the <stache-code>--template</stache-code> option to specify the <stache-code>library</stache-code> template.
  </p>

  <stache-code-block>
    skyux new --template library
  </stache-code-block>

  <p>
    This command uses the library template to create a SPA, and the library template places source files in <stache-code>/src/app/public</stache-code>.
  </p>

  <stache-page-anchor>
    Create components for the library
  </stache-page-anchor>
  
  <p>
    SKY UX Builder ignores components in <stache-code>/src/app/public</stache-code>, so they are not automatically declared in <stache-code>SkyModule</stache-code>. This allows you to write Angular modules, components, and services outside of SKY UX's scope.
  </p>

  <p>
    The entry point for your component library is <stache-code>/src/app/public/index.ts</stache-code>. This file is responsible for exporting any code you want to make available to the bundler.
  </p>

  <stache-page-anchor>
    Bundle the library
  </stache-page-anchor>
  
  <p>
    After you create a SPA and components for a library, the next step is to bundle the components into a consumable NPM module that you can publish to an NPM stream such as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npmjs.org</a>. To do this, run <stache-code>skyux build-public-library</stache-code> from the SKY UX CLI.
  </p>

  <stache-code-block>
    skyux build-public-library
  </stache-code-block>

  <p>
    This command creates a bundle that is NPM-ready and places it in a <stache-code>/dist</stache-code> directory. It bundles the components in <stache-code>/src/app/public</stache-code> and ignores all other files. Keep in mind that the command does not publish the component library.
  </p>

  <stache-page-anchor>
    Publish the library
  </stache-page-anchor>

  <p>
    After you bundle components into a consumable NPM module, you can publish the library to an NPM stream to allow other SKY UX SPAs to install the library. For public libraries, we recommend that you publish to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npmjs.org</a>. For Blackbaud developers, an internal-only NPM stream is also available to publish component libraries that are for internal Blackbaud use only.
  </p>

    (Add notes here about NPM feeds for both public and private libraries.) ... This was a placeholder that Steve left in place. I'm hiding it because I think I fleshed out the preceding  paragraph enough to handle this. But leaving it commented out instead of deleting as a reminder to ask Steve if he had additional info in mind.

  <h3>
    Publish a public library to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npmjs.org</a>
  </h3>

  <p>
    You can use Travis-CI to publish a component library to npmjs.org. Travis-CI is a free GitHub continuous integration service. To publish a library in the <stache-code>@blackbaud/*</stache-code> namespace, contact the SKY UX team to request a Travis-CI account. To publish a library in the <stache-code>@blackbaud/*</stache-code> namespace, you need to write some custom commands for Travis-CI to automatically publish your bundle to npmjs.org. For information about these custom commands, see <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/npm/">Releasing to NPM with Travis-CI</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Publish to a private library to Blackbaud's internal-only NPM stream
  </h3>

  <p>
    This option is for internal Blackbaud use only. To publish private libraries to Blackbaud's NPM stream, Blackbaud developers need to register the SPAs for their component libraries through the appropriate VSTS pipeline. Reach out to Jonathan Bell for more information.
  </p>

  <stache-page-anchor>
    Consume the library in another SPA
  </stache-page-anchor>

  <p>
    After you publish your component library, other SKY UX SPAs can install the library. To consume a SKY UX component library, the SPA imports the library through <stache-code>/app/src/app-extras.module.ts</stache-code>
  </p>
  <stache-code-block languageType="typescript">
    import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

    import { LibraryModule } from 'my-component-library';

    @NgModule({
      imports: [
        LibraryModule
      ],
      exports: [
        LibraryModule
      ]
    })
    export class AppExtrasModule { }
  </stache-code-block>

  <stache-page-anchor>
    Access the consuming SPA's configuration
  </stache-page-anchor>

  <p>
    After a SPA consumes a component library, the library requires an adapter in the consuming SPA to access <stache-code>SkyAppConfig</stache-code>.
  </p>

  <!--  <p>
    (Provide reasons for why SkyAppConfig cannot be accessed by the component library. Why we need to create the adaptor, etc.) ... This was a placeholder that Steve left in place. I'm hiding it because I think the next paragraph handles this. But leaving it commented out instead of deleting as a reminder to ask Steve if he had additional info in mind. 
  </p> -->

  <p>
    SKY UX does not transpile source files in <stache-code>@blackbaud/skyux-builder/runtime</stache-code> as a <a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/2014/what-is-amd-commonjs-and-umd/">UMD module</a>, so they cannot be <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/codelyzer">analyzed statically</a>. Therefore, a component library cannot directly reference <stache-code>@blackbaud/skyux-builder/runtime</stache-code> files such as <stache-code>SkyAppConfig</stache-code> because the library will eventually become a UMD module. Instead, the component library requires an adaptor class in the consuming SPA that can be provided in the transpiled version of <stache-code>SkyAppConfig</stache-code> at runtime.
  </p>

  <p>
    The following code sample demonstrates how to create an adaptor in the <stache-code>/app/src/app-extras.module.ts</stache-code> file in a consuming SPA.
  </p>

  <stache-code-block languageType="typescript">
    import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

    import { SkyAppConfig } from '@blackbaud/skyux-builder/runtime';

    import { LibraryModule, LibraryConfigService } from 'my-component-library';

    @NgModule({
      imports: [
        LibraryModule
      ],
      exports: [
        LibraryModule
      ],
      providers: [
        // The config service acts as an adaptor for skyuxconfig.json:
        {
          provide: LibraryConfigService,
          useExisting: SkyAppConfig
        }
      ]
    })
    export class AppExtrasModule { }
  </stache-code-block>

  <stache-page-anchor>
    Provide configuration for the library
  </stache-page-anchor>

  <p>
    After you create an adaptor in the consuming SPA's <stache-code>/app/src/app-extras.module.ts</stache-code> file, you can provide configuration for the library.
  </p>
  
  <p>To configure settings for a SKY UX SPA, you edit the <stache-code>skyuxconfig.json</stache-code> file in the project's directory. Within this file, the <stache-code>"appSettings"</stache-code> property specifies data that is available for reuse throughout the application, and you can use <stache-code>"appSettings"</stache-code> to add any properties that are necessary for the component library.
  </p>

  <stache-code-block languageType="json">
    {
      "appSettings": {
        "myLibrary": {
          "foo": "bar",
          "baz": true
        }
      }
    }
  </stache-code-block>

  <p>
    After you add any properties to <stache-code>"appSettings"</stache-code> for the component library, you can access the properties in your components by injecting the <stache-code>LibraryConfigService</stache-code> in <stache-code>/app/src/public/src/modules/shared/config.service.ts</stache-code>.
  </p>

  <stache-code-block languageType="typescript">
    import { LibraryConfigService } from '../shared';

    @Component({ ... })
    export class MyLibraryComponent {
      constructor(public configService: LibraryConfigService) {
        console.log(configService.appSettings.myLibrary.foo); // "bar"
      }
    }

  </stache-code-block>
</stache>
