SKY UX 2 provides Angular components, services, and modules to create user interfaces, and it takes advantage of Angular for tooling, testing, and performance. The SKY UX Builder developer tool provides for a rapid development process with minimal setup for developers to create single-page applications.

For guidance on how to install the command line interface for SKY UX Builder, see [the initial setup section of the SKY UX website](https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux/learn/get-started/prereqs/initial-setup).

To install just the SKY UX components without any additional features, use the following NPM command. We recommend NPM version 3+ for its flat dependency structure.

`npm install @blackbaud/skyux`

For documentation on the SKY UX components, see [the Components section of the SKY UX website](https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux/components).
