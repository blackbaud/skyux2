<stache-page-summary><p>SKY UX provides various form container patterns to accommodate different scenarios and workflow requirements.</p></stache-page-summary>

<stache-page-anchor>Inline panel</stache-page-anchor>
<p>An inline panel is appropriate for simple forms that meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The form has few fields, and its input controls are not complex.</li>
  <li>The content that surrounds the form will not distract users.</li>
  <li>The task is functionally non-modal, and users can abandon it while the form is open.</li>
</ul>

<stache-page-anchor>Modal dialog</stache-page-anchor>
<p>A <a routerLink="/components/modal">modal</a> dialog is appropriate for forms that meet any of the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The task is functionally modal, and users must finish it before doing anything else.</li>
  <li>Displaying the form inline would lead to substantial content shifting or require users to scroll to complete the form.</li>
  <li>The form adds records from a paginated list or an infinite scroll list.</li>
</ul>
  
<stache-page-anchor>Full-page modal</stache-page-anchor>
<p>A <a routerLink="/components/modal">full-page modal</a> is appropriate for forms that meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The task is functionally modal, and users must finish it before doing anything else.</li>
  <li>Users usually perform the task in a large viewport, and a full-page modal can optimize the use of space.</li>
  <li>The context of the task is self-contained.</li>
  <li>The form displays ancillary information or previews such as running totals or an email being constructed.</li>
  <li>The form supports a complex task for a list of objects such as filling out report cards for a class.</li>
<li>The task includes subtasks that need to be completed in context.</li>
</ul>

<stache-page-anchor>Wizard</stache-page-anchor>
<p>A <a routerLink="/components/wizard">wizard</a> is appropriate for forms that meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The task can be divided into discrete steps.</li>
  <li>The order of the steps is important.</li>
  <li>User actions in earlier steps affect later steps.</li>
  <li>Users must complete or review the fields in every step.</li>
  <li>Users might want to save their progress so that they can leave the form and return later.</li>
</ul>
