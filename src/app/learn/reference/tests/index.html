    <p>This reference provides guidance on unit tests and end-to-end tests in SKY UX projects. The continuous integration layer of SKY UX runs unit tests, visual regression tests, and end-to-end tests in multiple platforms and browsers when the SPA code changes or when an SPA dependency releases a new version. It also handles staging the SPA for additional testing and validation.</p>
