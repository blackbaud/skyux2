<stache-page-anchor>Add records</stache-page-anchor>

<div class="sky-subsection-heading">Add from a list</div>
  <p>This is likely the most common interaction to add records. The user goes to a list of existing records (and maybe searches for the specific record) to add the new record. This list could be its own page, or within a tile on a page. The add button opens a <a routerLink="/components/modal">modal</a> form. </p>

<div class="sky-subsection-heading">Add another</div>
<p>A user may also need to add several records in sequence. If these records include only a few fields, the user can use this pattern along with an inline add form. This is most likely to come up when the user fills out a form that can have multiple instances of a child record. For example, when adding a constituent, the user may want to add multiple phone numbers.</p>

<div class="sky-subsection-heading">Add from a search field</div>
<p>A record may need to reference another record, such as a donation that references a constituent. If the referenced record does not exist yet, it needs to be added on the fly. The user should search first to avoid creating a duplicate record. After confirming that the referenced record does not exist, the user can invoke the add form.</p>

<div class="sky-subsection-heading">Add child records</div>
<p>Some record types have many associated child records. For example, a constituent record has contact information, relationships, and notes, among other child records. While some of this information is available  when the parent record is created, much of it is added afterwards. Instead of adding all this information through a master form, the user can add it from the parent record page. The method to add the information depends on the other guidelines here and in the <a routerLink="../form-containers">form container guidelines</a>.</p>

<stache-page-anchor>Edit records</stache-page-anchor>

<div class="sky-subsection-heading">Edit from a list</div>
<p>A user should be able to edit a record from a list via the context menu without going to the page for the specific record. If the record is complex, the user may only be able to edit core information and have to go to the record page to edit ancillary information. This guideline applies to full-page lists and lists within a tile.</p>

<div class="sky-subsection-heading">Edit from a record page</div>
  
<div class="sky-emphasized">Core information</div>  
<p>On a record page, a user should be able to open an edit form from the page summary toolbar to edit the record's core information.</p>

<p><img src="~/assets/img/guidelines/managingrecords/edit-from-record.png" alt="Edit core information from a record page"/></p>

<div class="sky-emphasized">Non-list information</div>
<p>Some types of information are presented in non-list format, such as a definition list or text block. A user should be able to open an edit form through an edit button on the top right side of the content block.</p>

<p><img src="~/assets/img/guidelines/managingrecords/edit-non-list.png" alt="Edit non-list-based information"/></p>
  
<div class="sky-emphasized">Tiles with multiple types of non-list information</div>
<p>A page may include tiles with multiple types of information in a compact manner. In these cases, a user should be able to open an edit form through a split edit button in the tile toolbar that avoids multiple edit buttons in close proximity within the tile.</p>

<stache-page-anchor>Remove records</stache-page-anchor>

<div class="sky-subsection-heading">Delete records</div>

<div class="sky-emphasized">From a list</div>  
<p>Records that are less systemically important or have a low cost of re-creation in the case of accidental deletion can be deleted through the context menu in a list.</p>
<p><img src="~/assets/img/guidelines/managingrecords/delete-from-list.png" alt="Delete record from a list"/></p>

<div class="sky-emphasized">From a record page</div>  
<p>Systemically important records should be deleted from the record page rather than a list. This provides an extra level of safety to prevent accidentally deleting a record incorrectly by requiring the user to take extra steps. Deleting important records should be rare, so this extra interaction will not be overly burdensome.</p>
<p><img src="~/assets/img/guidelines/managingrecords/delete-from-record.png" alt="Delete record from the record page"/></p>
  
<div class="sky-subsection-heading">Removing temporary items</div>
<p>Some types of information such as list filters are only needed temporarily. The user should be able to remove these via a button using the “fa-close” icon. </p>

<p><img src="~/assets/img/guidelines/managingrecords/remove-filter.png" alt="Remove item via close button"/></p>

<div class="sky-subsection-heading">Mark records inactive</div>
<p>Some types of information need to be preserved in the system beyond active usefulness for audit or historical reference purposes. Since this action is reversible, it can be accessed from lists even for systemically important types of records.</p>
