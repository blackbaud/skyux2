  <p><stache-code>skyux test</stache-code> runs unit tests. The Karma unit test is configured under the hood to look for specific file names, similar to how SKY UX Builder looks for <stache-code>index.html</stache-code> files. The Karma unit test looks for any files in the <stache-code>src/app</stache-code> folder with names that end in <stache-code>.spec.ts</stache-code>. Users should write separate tests to confirm that the components work. For more information about unit tests, see <a routerLink="/learn/reference/tests">the unit test reference</a>.</p>
