<stache
    pageTitle="End-to-end (e2e) tests">

    <p>SKY UX automatically configures <a href="http://www.protractortest.org">Protractor</a> to run end-to-end tests in the <stache-code>e2e</stache-code> folder that match the <stache-code>.e2e-spec.ts</stache-code> pattern. We recommend that you follow the <a href="https://angular.io/styleguide#!#naming">Angular 2 naming guidelines</a> on how to name spec files and where to store them. SKY UX end-to-end tests should use the same name as the components or services that they test, but they should end with <stache-code>.e2e-spec.ts.</stache-code> Unlike unit tests, you should not place these spec files in the same folder as the components or services that they test. Instead, you should place them in the <stache-code>e2e</stache-code> folder in the root of your project.</p>
    <p>When you <a routerLink="/learn/tutorials/create-project">create a SKY UX project</a>, the template includes a sample end-to-end test that <a routerLink="/learn/tutorials/test/e2e-test">you can run to test the default single-page application</a>. From the command line, you can use <a routerLink="/learn/reference/cli-commands">the <stache-code>skyux e2e</stache-code> command</a> to run end-to-end tests.</p>
