      <p>
        SKY UX 2 is a new version of Blackbaud's user experience framework. The UX framework brings a consistent, cohesive experience to our products and allows third-party developers to provide the same consistent experience in their customizations and applications. With AngularJS now in maintenance mode and Angular 2 in general availability, SKY UX 2 takes advantage of <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular 2</a> to keep SKY UX modern while increasing the tooling, testing, and performance available.
