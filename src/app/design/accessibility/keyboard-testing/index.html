    1. Use the Tab key to move through a page or component
  </stache-page-anchor>
  <p>Ensure that navigation with the Tab key meets the following criteria:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>The Tab key places focus on all focusable elements.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The Tab key does not place focus on elements that cannot receive focus.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A visual indication occurs when each element receives focus.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The order of focus follows the sequence and relationships in the page or component.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The page or component does not experience any substantial change when an element receives focus. For example, it does not experience substantial change when a modal opens or focus changes again.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The Tab key moves focus throughout the page without becoming trapped. It moves from top to bottom or bottom to top (Shift-Tab) and starts over when it reaches the bottom or top.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <stache-page-anchor>
    2. Use all interactive elements and controls
  </stache-page-anchor>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Ensure that the keyboard can access all interactive elements and controls.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Press Enter to activate links and buttons.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Press arrow keys and the space bar to navigate to and select/deselect radio buttons, checkboxes, tabs, dropdown menus, navigation menus, autocomplete fields, and other elements and controls.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>For information about keyboard use for different types of controls, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-wai-aria-practices-1.1-20160317/">WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Ensure that entering data in form inputs such as radio buttons, checkboxes, and text fields  does not substantially change the page or reload it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Test error messages.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Ensure that the focus is placed on the error message or that an ARIA technique is used to announce error.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Ensure that the message includes a suggestion for how to fix the error.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Ensure that users can move focus directly from the error message to the error.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <stache-page-anchor>
    3. Use all modal dialogs
  </stache-page-anchor>
  <p>Ensure that navigation with the Tab key meets the following criteria:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>The Tab key places focus on elements that open modal dialogs, and pressing Enter opens the dialog and places focus on the first element or the title.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The Tab key places focus on all focusable elements.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The Tab key does not place focus on elements that cannot receive focus.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Focus remains in the modal and does not return to the page.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>When the Tab key places focus on an element that closes the modal, pressing Enter closes the modal.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>When the modal closes, focus returns to the element that opened the modal or goes to a logical place based on actions within the modal. Focus does not return the top of the underlying page.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
