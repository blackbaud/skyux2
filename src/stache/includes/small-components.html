<sky-alert alertType="info">As a best practice, we recommend that components should be small and single-purpose, and we recommend breaking up larger components into smaller, more cohesive components. Smaller components are easier to test because you can isolate functionality to ensure that components are immune to changes in other components. In general, larger components lead to larger tests that are more difficult to write and more difficult to understand.</sky-alert>
