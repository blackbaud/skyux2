         Is SKY UX accessible?
      </stache-page-anchor>
    <p>An accessible UX framework is an important part of Blackbaud’s commitment to deliver solutions that help drive positive change in the world. We endeavor to meet the World Wide Web Consortium’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> Level A and AA success criteria. In SKY UX, we build support for accessibility into our components.</p>

    <h3>Known issues</h3>
    <p>Accessibility is a work-in-progress and something we focus on improving within SKY UX. When we identify accessibility issues with SKY UX components, we log the issues in <a href="https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aaccessibility">the SKY UX GitHub repo</a>.</p>
