  <p><stache-code>skyux serve</stache-code> serves the current SKY UX single-page application locally. This command also opens the <stache-code>host</stache-code> endpoint with the necessary query string to pull your local files. It tacks on <stache-code>local=true</stache-code> in the query string to instruct SKY UX Host to pull files from the local machine instead of the hosted location. By default, the SPA automatically opens in the default browser, but you can specify a different browser with the <stache-code>--browser</stache-code> option. Or you can add the <stache-code>--launch none</stache-code> option to prevent the SPA from opening. The <stache-code>serve</stache-code> command basically updates the production location rather than creating a duplicate local instance, so to view the production version alongside a local version, you need to open a separate incognito tab. The <stache-code>serve</stache-code> command sets a cookie to apply local dev mode. Keep in mind that since <stache-code>skyux serve</stache-code> serves your single-page application over HTTPS, any additional requests from your code such as AJAX requests must also be over HTTPS.</p>
      <sky-alert alertType="info">If you serve in Internet Explorer 11 or Microsoft Edge, the default browser settings can cause the SPA to reload indefinitely. To fix the browser settings, open the <strong>Control Panel</strong> from the <strong>Start</strong> menu and select <strong>Internet Options</strong>. On the Internet Properties screen, go to the Security tab and click <strong>Local intranet</strong>. Then click <strong>Sites</strong>, and on the Local intranet screen, clear <strong>Include all local (intranet) sites not listed in other zones</strong>. Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the change and then click <strong>OK</strong> on the Internet Properties screen.
