    <p>An accessible UX framework is an important part of Blackbaud’s commitment to deliver solutions that help drive positive change in the world. We endeavor to meet the World Wide Web Consortium’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> Level A and AA success criteria. In SKY UX, we build support for accessibility into our components.</p>
  </stache-page-summary>
    <p>This page outlines the best practices to follow when you to contribute to SKY UX. And since accessibility is a work-in-progress, we provide information about known issues as necessary.</p>

    Design for users with differing abilities
  </stache-page-anchor>
  <p>Focus on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/intro.html#introduction-fourprincs-head">four principles that make experiences accessible</a> for people with differing abilities. The design must be <strong>perceivable</strong> to all user senses. User interface components and navigation must be <strong>operable</strong> for users to interact with the interface. Information and the operation of the user interface must be <strong>understandable</strong>. And content must be <strong>robust</strong> enough for a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies, to reliably interpret it.</p>
  <p>Evaluate your design ideas from the perspectives of users with disabilities. Become familiar with the <a href="http://webaim.org/articles/userperspective/">design issues and solutions for various disabilities</a>.</p>
  <h3>SKY UX design evaluation</h3>
  <p>We utilize a UI design accessibility checklist to evaluate new patterns and components for SKY UX. New components are reviewed against this checklist to ensure that they meet WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA success criteria.</p>

    Code using best practices
  </stache-page-anchor>
  <p>The following best practices help to ensure that SKY UX supports accessibility features and meets WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA success criteria.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Use structural semantic markup. This ensures that the role of elements and their relationships is available programmatically to user agents that help to communicate the content's meaning.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/getting-to-know-html/">HTML semantics overview</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/semantics-accessibility/">Text-level semantics, microdata, and WAI-ARIA roles</a></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Apply <a href="http://webaim.org/articles/">accessible techniques to HTML</a> forms, tables, links, media, and scripting, as well as to keyboard use.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If you create custom interactive components or use HTML elements differently than the default semantics:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Follow the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/aria-in-html/#notes-on-aria-use-in-html">five rules of Accessible Rich Internet Applications</a> (ARIA) from the W3C recommendation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Follow the W3C's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-wai-aria-practices-1.1-20160317/">WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1</a>.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <stache-page-anchor>
    Test for accessibility
  </stache-page-anchor>
  <p>SKY UX employs several methods to test for accessibility. To contribute to SKY UX, follow these methods for your feature before you submit it.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Run <a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core">aXe automated tests</a> until they all pass. aXe is an open source library of automated accessibility tests that can identify potential issues for a subset of the WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA success criteria. aXe is integrated into SKY UX.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Perform a review using the SKY UX <a routerLink="/learn/contribute/accessibility/code-review">accessibility code review checklist</a> to identify potential accessibility problems that automated aXe testing could not evaluate.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Complete <a routerLink="/learn/contribute/accessibility/keyboard-testing">manual keyboard tests</a> to ensure that people can use your feature with a keyboard only.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Have users with various disabilities test your feature.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
