        <p>SKY UX provides a consistent, cohesive user experience for Blackbaud products. The framework includes the components, services, and modules that developers need to incorporate Blackbaud styles and patterns.</p>
    </stache-page-summary>

    <p>Starting with SKY UX 2, the framework also provides additional benefits. The SKY UX Builder developer tool takes the application-building aspects of Angular and wraps them up to abstract many of the complexities of modern web development. We still expect developers to write JavaScript/TypeScript and build features, but we donâ€™t expect them to handle all the underlying details. In addition, SKY UX 2 includes a continuous integration layer for testing and validation, and SKY UX Host provides a hosting solution for Blackbaud applications.</p>
    <sky-alert alertType="info">Keep in mind that <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> is at the heart of SKY UX, so developers need to be familiar with this technology to build with SKY UX. For training materials on Angular and other SKY UX tools and technologies, see <a routerLink="/learn/reference/resources">the training resources.</a></sky-alert>
    <!--
    <p>SKY UX 2 enables developers to focus on features instead of infrastructure. It creates user experience interactions and allows feature engineers to consume them.</p>

        What's new in SKY UX 2
    </stache-page-anchor>
    <p>SKY UX 2 continues to provide the same benefits as the previous version of SKY UX: Its Angular components, services, and modules enable developers to create user interfaces that incorporate SKY UX styles and patterns. SKY UX design patterns allow developers to implement a consistent, cohesive user experience and provide guidance on how to apply components and the context for when to use them.</p>
    <p>In addition, SKY UX 2 also includes the following improvements and new capabilities:</p>
    <sky-alert alertType="info">Components, services, and modules are open source and available to external developers in <a href="https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2">the SKY UX 2 GitHub repo</a>, but some SKY UX 2 features are for internal Blackbaud use only.</sky-alert>
    <ul>
        <li><p>SKY UX 2 takes advantage of <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular 2</a> to keep SKY UX modern while increasing the tooling, testing, and performance available. Components, services, and modules are open source in <a href="https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2">the SKY UX 2 GitHub repo</a>.</p></li>
        <li><p>SKY UX Builder provides for a rapid development process with minimal developer setup. It creates single-page applications and handles configuration details for developers.</p></li>
        <li><p>The continuous integration layer runs unit tests, visual regression tests, and end-to-end tests in multiple platforms and browsers when a SPA's code changes or when a dependency releases a new version. This layer also stages the SPA for additional testing and validation. <!-- The CI layer is primarily for internal Blackbaud use, but external developers can take advantage of tests when developing locally in SKY UX SPAs. However, it is not open source like the components, services, and modules in <a href="https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2">the SKY UX 2 GitHub repo</a>. --></p></li>
        <li><p>SKY UX Host acts as a gateway for all requests to SKY UX SPAs. When serving locally, it pulls files locally. And for production, it pulls files from a registry that stores static files. <!-- Host is primarily for internal Blackbaud use, but when external developers use the SKY UX CLI to serve SKY UX SPAs locally, Host loads local files. However, is not open source like the components, services, and modules in <a href="https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2">the SKY UX 2 GitHub repo</a>. --></p></li>
    </ul>

        SKY UX Builder
    </stache-page-anchor>
    <p>SKY UX Builder is cross-platform, command line developer tool to create, test, and run SPAs. It abstracts most of the tedious complexities of modern web development, including bundling configuration, unit test configuration, and routing/module configuration. This allows developers to focus on features, not infrastructure. And it enables developers to build, test, deploy, and host SPAs in a consistent way across an entire application.</p>
    <sky-alert alertType="info">External developers can use Builder to create, test, and run SKY UX SPAs, but some features are for internal Blackbaud use only.</sky-alert>
    <p>In addition, SKY UX Builder also:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Handles details such as transpilation, linting, unit testing, and bundling/chunking/minifying.</p></li>
        <li><p>Uses automatic route configuration by default based on a project's folder structure. This means you must place files in specific locations to make sure that they are recognized. For example, to create a page, you create a folder in the existing <stache-code>\src\app</stache-code> folder and then create an <stache-code>index.html</stache-code> file in that folder. For more information about where to place files, see <a routerLink="/learn/reference/naming-and-placement">the file name and placement reference</a>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Provides build and testing configurations. This includes settings to use Webpack to handle minification and build JavaScript assets, Karma unit tests, and Protractor end-to-end tests.</p></li>
        <li><p>Allows for easy implementation of Blackbaud Authentication.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <stache-page-anchor>
        Continuous integration layer
    </stache-page-anchor>
    <p>The continuous integration layer of SKY UX runs unit tests, visual regression tests, and end-to-end tests in multiple platforms and browsers when SPA code changes or when a dependency releases a new version. It also handles staging SPAs for additional testing and validation.</p>
    <sky-alert alertType="info">The CI layer is primarily for internal Blackbaud use. External developers can use this layer when developing SPAs locally, but it is not open source like the components, services, and modules in <a href="https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2">the SKY UX 2 GitHub repo</a>.</sky-alert>

    <stache-page-anchor>
        SKY UX Host
    </stache-page-anchor>
    <p>SKY UX Host is the gateway for requests to SKY UX SPAs. During local development, SKY UX Host loads local files. And for production, SKY UX Host loads bundled files from a CDN where SKY UX Builder stores them.</p>
    <sky-alert alertType="info">Host is primarily for internal Blackbaud use. When external developers use the SKY UX CLI to serve SKY UX SPAs locally, Host loads local files. However, Host is not open source like the components, services, and modules in <a href="https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2">the SKY UX 2 GitHub repo</a>.</sky-alert>
    <!--
    <p>When the builder runs in the continuous integration layer, it stores the static files that it produces (JavaScript, JSON, etc.) in the registry for SKY UX Host to serve them.</p>
    <sky-alert alertType="info">The only special requirement to host internal Blackbaud implementations is web hooks in the Git repo to the SKY UX continuous integration layer. For now, this must be set up manually by the SKY UX team. Contact the SKY UX team on the <a href="https://blackbaud.slack.com/messages/1bb-skyux-apps/">1bb-skyux-apps Slack channel</a>.</sky-alert>
    -->
    <p>SKY UX Host also creates a web service that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Serves up an HTML page to host the SPA.</p></li>
        <li><p>Sets the appropriate cache headers for the HTML page and static files.</p></li>
        <li><p>Sets the appropriate handlers to support HTML 5-style routing.</p></li>
        <li><p>Serves as an origin for a content delivery network (CDN).</p></li>
        <li><p>Registers JavaScript and CSS for the SPA. This includes registering locale files based on browser culture, using sub-resource integrity to check for CDN-hosted files, and using a fallback strategy for when the CDN is unavailable.</p></li>
        <li><p>Implements HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).</p></li>
        <li><p>Obtains, configures, and deploys SSL certificates.</p></li>
        <li><p>Maintains high availability through load-balancing, georeplication, and monitoring.</p></li>
    </ul>
