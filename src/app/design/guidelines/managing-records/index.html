<stache-page-anchor>Add records</stache-page-anchor>

<div class="sky-subsection-heading" style="margin-top: 20px;">Add from a list</div>
  <p>This is likely the most common interaction to add records. The user goes to a list of existing records (and maybe searches for a specific record) to add a record. This list can be its own page or within a tile on a page. The add button opens a <a routerLink="/components/modal">modal</a> form. </p>

<div class="sky-subsection-heading" style="margin-top: 20px;">Add another</div>
<p>A user may also need to add several records in sequence. If the records include only a few fields, the user can use this pattern along with an inline add form. This is most likely to come up when the user fills out a form that can have multiple instances of a child record. For example, when adding a constituent, the user may want to add multiple phone numbers.</p>

<div class="sky-subsection-heading" style="margin-top: 20px;">Add from a search field</div>
<p>A record may need to reference another record, such as a donation that references a constituent. If the referenced record does not exist, the user needs to add it on the fly. The user should search first to avoid duplicate records. After confirming that the record to reference does not exist, the user can invoke the add form.</p>

<div class="sky-subsection-heading" style="margin-top: 20px;">Add child records</div>
<p>Some record types have many associated child records. For example, a constituent record has contact information, relationships, notes, and other child records. While some of this information is available  when the parent record is created, much of it is added afterwards. Instead of adding information through a master form, the user can add it from the parent record page. The method to add the information depends on the other guidelines here and in the <a routerLink="../form-containers">form containers guidelines</a>.</p>

<stache-page-anchor>Edit records</stache-page-anchor>

<div class="sky-subsection-heading" style="margin-top: 20px;">Edit from a list</div>
<p>A user should be able to edit a record from a list via the context menu without going to the page for the specific record. If the record is complex, the user may only be able to edit core information and may need to go to the record page to edit ancillary information. This guideline applies to full-page lists and lists within tiles.</p>

<div class="sky-subsection-heading" style="margin-top: 20px;">Edit from a record page</div>
  
<div class="sky-emphasized" style="margin-top: 10px;">Core information</div>  
<p>On a record page, a user should be able to open an edit form from the page summary toolbar to edit the record's core information.</p>

<div class="sky-emphasized" style="margin-top: 10px;">Non-list information</div>
<p>Some types of information are presented in non-list formats such as definition lists or text blocks. A user should be able to open an edit form through an edit button on the top right side of these content blocks.</p>

<div><img class="screenshot screenshot-info" src="~/assets/img/guidelines/managingrecords/edit-non-list.png" alt="Edit non-list-based information"/></div>
  
<div class="sky-emphasized" style="margin-top: 10px;">Tile with multiple types of non-list information</div>
<p>A page can include tiles with multiple types of information in a compact space. In these cases, a user should be able to open an edit form through a split edit button in the tile toolbar that avoids multiple edit buttons in close proximity.</p>

<stache-page-anchor>Remove records</stache-page-anchor>

<div class="sky-subsection-heading" style="margin-top: 20px;">Delete records</div>

<div class="sky-emphasized" style="margin-top: 10px;">From a list</div>  
<p>A user should be able to delete records that are not systemically important and records with a low cost of re-creation through the context menu in a list.</p>
<div><img class="screenshot screenshot-info" src="~/assets/img/guidelines/managingrecords/delete-from-list.png" alt="Delete record from a list"/></div>

<div class="sky-emphasized" style="margin-top: 10px;">From a record page</div>  
<p>A user should delete systemically important records from the record page instead of a list. The extra step provides additional safety to help prevent the user from accidentally deleting a record. Deleting important records should be rare, so the extra step will not be overly burdensome.</p>

<div class="sky-subsection-heading" style="margin-top: 20px;">Remove temporary items</div>
<p>Some types of information such as list filters are only needed temporarily. A user should be able to remove these via a button using the “fa-close” icon. </p>

<div><img class="screenshot screenshot-info" src="~/assets/img/guidelines/managingrecords/remove-filter.png" alt="Remove item via close button"/></div>

<div class="sky-subsection-heading" style="margin-top: 20px;">Mark records inactive</div>
<p>Some types of information need to be preserved in the system beyond active usefulness for audit or historical reference purposes. Since this action is reversible, a user should be able to access it from lists even for systemically important records.</p>
