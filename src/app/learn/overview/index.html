    <h1>SKY UX 2 Overview</h1>
    <p>The SKY UX framework provides a consistent, cohesive user experience for Blackbaud products and for third-party developers. SKY UX provides the components, services, and modules that developers need to incorporate Blackbaud styles and patterns.</p>
    <p>And with SKY UX 2, the framework now provides additional benefits. First, the SKY UX Builder developer tool now abstracts many of the complexities of modern web development. SKY UX Builder takes the application-building aspects of Angular 2 and wraps them up. We still expect developers to write JavaScript/TypeScript and build features, but we don’t expect them to handle all the underlying details. In addition, SKY UX 2 includes a continuous integration layer for testing and validation, and SKY UX Host provides a hosting solution for Blackbaud applications.</p>
    <!--
    <p>SKY UX 2 enables developers to focus on features instead of infrastructure. It creates user experience interactions and allows feature engineers to consume them.</p>

    <h2>What's new in SKY UX 2</h2>
    <p>SKY UX 2 continues to provide many of the same benefits as the first version of SKY UX. It continues to provide design patterns to implement a consistent, cohesive user experience, guidance on how to apply components, and the context for when to use components. It also continues to provide Angular components, services, and modules to create user interfaces that incorporate SKY UX styles and patterns.</p>
    <p>In addition, SKY UX 2 includes the following improvements and new capabilities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>SKY UX 2 takes advantage of <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular 2</a> to keep SKY UX modern while increasing the tooling, testing, and performance available.</p></li>
        <li><p>SKY UX Builder provides for a rapid development process with minimal developer setup. It creates single-page applications and handles configuration details for developers.</p></li>
        <li><p>A continuous integration layer runs unit tests, visual regression tests, and end-to-end tests in multiple platforms and browsers when an SPA's code changes or when an SPA dependency releases a new version. This layer also stages the SPA for additional testing and validation.</p></li>
        <li><p>SKY UX Host acts as a gateway for all requests to SKY UX SPAs. When serving locally, it pulls files locally. And for production, it pulls files from a registry that stores static files.</p></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>SKY UX Builder</h2>
    <p>SKY UX Builder is cross-platform command line developer tool to create, test, and run SPAs. It abstracts most of the tedious complexities of modern web development, including bundling configuration, unit test configuration, and routing/module configuration. This allows developers to focus on features, not infrastructure. And it allows SPAs to be developed, tested, deployed, and hosted in a consistent way across an entire application.</p>
    <p>In addition, SKY UX Builder also:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Handles details such as transpilation, linting, unit testing, and bundling/chunking/minifying.</p></li>
        <li><p>Uses automatic route configuration by default based on a project's folder structure. This means you must place files in specific locations to make sure that they are recognized. For example, to create a page, you create a folder in the existing <code>\src\app</code> folder and then create an <code>index.html</code> file in that folder.</p></li>
        <li><p>Provides build and testing configurations. This includes settings to use Webpack to handle minification and build JavaScript assets, Karma unit tests, and Protractor end-to-end tests.</p></li>
        <li><p>Allows for easy implementation of Blackbaud Authentication.</p></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Continuous integration layer</h2>
    <p>The continuous integration layer of SKY UX runs unit tests, visual regression tests, and end-to-end tests in multiple platforms and browsers when the SPA code changes or when an SPA dependency releases a new version. It also handles staging the SPA for additional testing and validation.</p>
    <!--
    <p><strong>Placeholder to flesh out build and deploy information for developers.</strong></p>
    -->

    <h2>SKY UX Host</h2>
    <p>SKY UX Host is the gateway for requests to SKY UX SPAs. During local development, SKY UX Host loads local files. And for production, SKY UX Host loads bundled files from a CDN where SKY UX Builder stores them.</p>
    <!--
    <p>When the builder runs in the continuous integration layer, it stores the static files that it produces (JavaScript, JSON, etc.) in the registry for SKY UX Host to serve them.</p>
    <sky-alert alertType="info">The only special requirement to host internal Blackbaud implementations is web hooks in the Git repo to the SKY UX continuous integration layer. For now, this must be set up manually by the SKY UX team. Contact the SKY UX team on the <a href="https://blackbaud.slack.com/messages/1bb-skyux-apps/">1bb-skyux-apps Slack channel</a>.</sky-alert>
    -->
    <p>SKY UX Host also creates a web service that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Serves up an HTML page to host the SPA.</p></li>
        <li><p>Sets the appropriate cache headers for the HTML page and static files.</p></li>
        <li><p>Sets the appropriate handlers to support HTML 5-style routing.</p></li>
        <li><p>Serves as an origin for a content delivery network (CDN).</p></li>
        <li><p>Registers JavaScript and CSS for the SPA. This includes registering locale files based on browser culture, using sub-resource integrity checking for CDN-hosted files, and using a fallback strategy for when the CDN is unavailable.</p></li>
        <li><p>Implements HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).</p></li>
        <li><p>Obtains, configures, and deploys SSL certificates.</p></li>
        <li><p>Maintains high availability through load-balancing, georeplication, and monitoring.</p></li>
    </ul>
