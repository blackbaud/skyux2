    <h1>Unit tests</h1>
    <p>SKY UX automatically configures <a href="https://karma-runner.github.io">Karma</a> to run unit tests in the <code>src\app</code> folder that match the <code>.spec.ts</code> pattern. We recommend that you follow the <a href="https://angular.io/styleguide#!#naming">Angular 2 naming guidelines</a> on how to name spec files and where to store them. SKY UX unit tests should use the same name as the components or services that they test, but they should end with <code>.spec.ts.</code> And you place the spec files in the same folder as the components or services that they test. When you run <code>skyux test</code> or <code>skyux watch</code>, code coverage results are stored in the <code>coverage</code> folder.</p>
    <p>When you <a routerLink="/learn/tutorials/create-project">create a SKY UX project</a>, the template includes sample unit tests that <a routerLink="/learn/tutorials/test/unit-test">you can run to test the default single-page-application</a>. From the command line, you can use <a routerLink="/learn/reference/cli-commands">the <code>skyux test</code> command</a> to run unit tests and <a routerLink="/learn/reference/cli-commands">the <code>skyux watch</code> command</a> to run unit tests and watch the file system for changes.</p>
    <p>SKY UX styles are loaded when running unit tests, so CSS rules defined in SKY UX take effect during tests. This allows you to check the expected computed style of an element when using things like the HTML <code>hidden</code> property that only take effect when SKY UX styles are loaded.</p>
