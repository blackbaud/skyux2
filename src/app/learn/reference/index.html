    <p>The technical references provide resources to help manage SKY UX projects. They include information about the SKY UX CLI commands, configuration options for the SKY UX process, and conventions for file names and placement.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> is at the heart of SKY UX 2, so you need to be familiar with this technology to build with SKY UX. For learning resources for Angular and other SKY UX tools and technologies, see <a routerLink="/learn/resources">the training resources.</a></p>
  <sky-alert alertType="info">External developers should keep in mind that some SKY UX options described in the technical references are for internal Blackbaud use only. External developers can take advantage of SKY UX to create, test, and run SKY UX SPAs, and the SKY UX components, services, and modules are open source and available in <a href="https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2">the SKY UX 2 GitHub repo</a>. However, not all SKY UX features are available for external use.</sky-alert>
