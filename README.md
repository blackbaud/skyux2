A beta version of SKY UX 2 is now available. In addition to Angular components, services, and modules to create user interfaces, the new version takes advantage of Angular 2 to increase the tooling, testing, and performance available, and it also provides the SKY UX Builder developer tool to provide for a rapid development process with minimal setup for developers to create single-page applications.

For guidance on how to install the command line interface for SKY UX Builder, see [the initial setup section of the SKY UX 2 website](https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux2/learn/get-started/2.-initial-setup).

To install just the SKY UX 2 components without any additional features, use the following NPM command. We recommend NPM version 3+ for its flat dependency structure.

`npm install @blackbaud/skyux`

For documentation on the SKY UX 2 components, see [the Components section of the SKY UX 2 website](https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux2/components).
