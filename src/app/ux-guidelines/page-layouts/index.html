<div class="sky-section-heading">Grid system</div>
<p>SKYUX layouts use a fluid grid system that can respond as the size of the viewport changes. Our grid columns have 15px in padding on both sides to create 30px gutters between columns and 15px gutters at the edges of the grid. The columns are fluid, but the gutters remain constant.</p>

<p>This grid system allows for a variety of page layouts but still conforms to our design and coding standards.</p>

<div class="sky-section-heading">Responsive design</div>
<p>We rely the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ui/responsive/patterns/column-drop">column drop pattern</a> to create responsive designs. This pattern utilizes a multi-column layout and the full width of the screen. The column drop pattern displays columns horizontally at full width and then stacks columns vertically when the screen width becomes too narrow for the content. When and how to stack columns at different breakpoints will vary depending on the content of the design.</p>

<div class="sky-section-heading">Page layout templates</div>
<p>SKYUX is a flexible system that allows for a variety of page layouts to solve workflow needs while maintaining a consistent feel across an application.</p>

<p>The following sections describe the standard page layouts for designing with SKYUX. These layouts show how to package components to suit a variety of user needs, but the system can accommodate alternate layout designs as necessary.</p>

<div class="sky-subsection-heading">Work center</div>
<p>The work center layout provides a <a routerLink="../../components/tiles">tile-based</a> page that surfaces time-sensitive information and allows users to quickly navigate to the most recent information within an application. It can contain a <a routerLink="../../components/pagesummary">page summary</a> to highlight the most important information, a <a routerLink="../../components/tabs">tabbed layout</a> to support different tasks, and a <a routerLink="../../components/carousel">carousel</a> to feature high-priority items.</p>

<div class="sky-subsection-heading">List page</div>
<p>The list page layout provides a page that displays a list of related data. Common controls allow users to select the columns to display, sort the list, filter the list, search, and switch views. List pages can use tabs to display multiple lists or pre-filtered instances of a single list.</p>

<div class="sky-subsection-heading">Record page</div>
<p>The record page layout provides a <a routerLink="../../components/tiles">tile-based</a> page that displays a <a routerLink="../../components/pagesummary">page summary</a> and a main content area. The page summary at the top of the page provides an overview of a record. The main content area usually consists of two columns of tiles (or one column on extra small screens) that display information about the record in logical sections. The content to include in each area depends on the page's use case.</p>
